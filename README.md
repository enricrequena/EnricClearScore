Clear Score Technical Test

This test app only uses one cocoa pod repository, that is 'Toast-Swift'. The reason for using this library was to demonstrate an integration using cocoa pods and take advantage of its easy to use extensions to display error messages as an alternative of using an UIAlertController.

To run the app you will need to clone this repository, run a pod install and enjoy.

Note: I've left some ToDo's for things that I did not have time to complete (some tests).
